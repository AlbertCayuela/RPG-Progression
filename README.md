### What is the objective of a good RPG progression system?

Essentially, a good RPG progression system objective is to make de player not detect the infinite game loop that every game has.

Avoid the feeling of repetition the same action over and over again while the player is playing.

Provide the player with a good and long-term desicion-making system, which let him take desicions for future sessions of playing.

Having a good game progression means having a balanced progression, if we are not able to achieve this, our player will be frustrated due to it.

### Why is important to have a good progression system?

When a player plays a game and does not feel any progression, he can feel frustrated and thar can bring him to leave the game.

Our objective when we make a game is to make our player enjoy when he is playing. If we achieve this, the player will remain loyal to our product. If our progression system is good enough, this will be much easier.

### How does a bad progression system look like?

- We will find that the player feels that he is repeating the process over and over again without finding any motivation to keep playing, he gets bored so fast.
- We find skinner boxes, the game loop is boring and repetitive, the game bases its loop in repeating action and rewarding randomly the player when he does an especific action.
- A clear example of good progression system lack are game that abuse of 'grinding'. It is something that is not bad to do sometimes but, if the game progression is based on that, the game will be so repetitive and broing for the player.

### What does progression apport?

Gustavo Tondello's explanation:

Progression apports the player the feeling that he is overcoming the obstacles he finds during his game sessions. This allows him to feel ready too for the new ones that will come in the future.

To achieve this we have to meet three conditions:

- Clear goals: the player has to be sure of what are his next steps and what he wants to achieve.
- Immediate and constant feedback.
- Balance between the perceived challenge and the perceived level of skill needed; the player has te be aware of what skill he has every moment, he has to be able to detect what challenges he can pass and what challenges he cannot pass.

If we meet these three conditions our player will feel that he has our game under control, something that allow us the keep him playing and stisfied.
