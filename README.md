### What is the objective of a good RPG progression system?

Essentially, a good RPG progression system objective is to make de player not detect the infinite game loop that every game has.
Avoid the feeling of repetition the same action over and over again while the player is playing.
Provide the player with a good and long-term desicion-making system, which let him take desicions for future sessions of playing.
